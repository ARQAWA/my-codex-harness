# Light Review Cycle

Use only on explicit invocation. Select `agent_type=spotty` (`gpt-6-sol`,
reasoning `low`) and one clean pass per checkpoint.

Read and follow the [shared blind contract](../high-review-cycle/SKILL.md),
including target selection, `review_stage` (`pre-action` or `pre-completion`),
the frozen object and packet, fresh read-only reviewers, finding admission,
and batch repair. Preserve Spotty and the single-pass requirement after repairs.
Reading the shared contract does not select Smarty or launch another cycle.
